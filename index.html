	<p>When someone approaches her with troubling dreams or nightmares, she begins by administering a special brew made from the yagé (ayahuasca), which acts as a catalyst for her Dreamweaving power. As they drift into a deep, trance-like state, she enters their dreamscape, a surreal realm where she can manipulate and control the nightmares. She uses this power to transform thesefrightening visions into something less menacing, guiding the dreamer through their fears and extracting the nightmarish energy in the process. Once she has absorbed the essence of these nightmares, she stores the energy in a mystical, ethereal vessel that she carries with her. This vessel is a small, ornate container fashioned from natural materials, adorned with intricate carvings and charms. The collected nightmares can be used later during her own rituals or for other purposes that align with her protective and spiritual practices.</p>
	
	
<p>In her rituals, she utilizes this extracted nightmare energy by blending it with the yagé drink, creating potent brews that allow her to channel and control the nightmarish forces she has collected. This combination enables her to perform powerful ceremonies, fortify her protective spells, or even confront dark forces that threaten her people. The energy of the nightmares, when used with the yagé, enhances her abilities, granting her deeper insight and greater control over the mystical realms she navigates.</p>
