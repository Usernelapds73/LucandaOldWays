<h3> Lucanda's place </h3>

<p>She now lives in the city, which is full of the sounds of cars and buses. Her younger granddaughters brought her out of the Amazon. She has a small room in the house that she has made into her own home. She keeps some birds, snakes, and poison frogs, so their sounds are
always around. She also sings a little lullaby to herself whenever she is alone at home. Normally, every full moon, she dances with her granddaughtersâ€™ family and makes offerings to the gods, so these sounds mix with the noise of cars and street vendors outside her house.</p>
